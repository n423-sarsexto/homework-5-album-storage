The purpose of this application is to work with a Firebase project that allows querying, retrieval, and addition of Firestore data. In this particular instance, Albums are used. Users can add albums, as well as sort by three pre-determined album genres.

There is a check that runs to make sure users leave no field blank. There also is a confirmation alert that appears once a user's album has been added, because it does not always appear at the very top.
